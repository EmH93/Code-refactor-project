# <Week-one-challenge>

## Description

A Repository for the content of the front end development bootcamp - week one challenge. This project is an on the job ticket for a marketing company who are looking to make their website more accessible to all users, by adhering to accessibility standards. As well as amending the accessibility in this project I took the opportunity to streamline the code by removing unecessary code repitition and broken hyperlinks, as well as adding semantic tagging and comments to the files.


## Installation

I amended the existing css and html code to ensure all image and icons are accessible as well as fixing a broken link on the Search Engine Optimization button in the navigation bar

## Usage

Once you have accessed the website, it can be navigated in the following way (screenshots for reference). By clicking on one of the three options on the top bar (Search Engine Optimization, Online Reputation Management or Social Media Marketing) - as shown below, you can navigate around the page.

```md
    ![Website header navigation bar](/starter/assets/images/Website-navigation.PNG)
    ```

From clicking on one of the navigation options, the page will navigate the user to the appropriate area of the web page.

```md
    ![Main articles of the web page](/starter/assets/images/Website-main.PNG)
    ```
